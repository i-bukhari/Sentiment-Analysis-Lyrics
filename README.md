# Sentiment-Analysis-Lyrics

Sentiment Analysis of Lyrics is an upcoming subfield of the broader NLP field. With advancements in song recommendation systems like Spotify, the need for sentiment analysis of songs has become important. There are two ways we can sentiment analysis: lyrics and sound. This project focuses on comparing different approaches to predict the sentiment of songs using lyrics. We explain the pipeline of extracting data, cleaning, preprocessing, feature extraction, model selection and evaluation. We compare our models with ready-to-use sentiment analyzers, VADER and TextBlob. We compare our models using not only accuracy and f1 score but also specificity as it is important to classify songs of negative sentiments. Our results show potential model and feature combinations that can be developed further to develop a more robust sentiment analysis tool.
